# Waypoint

Connecting people when cellular networks fail.

## About

Waypoint is a MagSafe device that attaches to your iPhone and creates a mesh network, enabling calls, video calls, texts, and location sharing up to 3km apart—without cellular data.

From crowded events to crisis situations where power is down to sparsely populated areas, Waypoint keeps people connected.
