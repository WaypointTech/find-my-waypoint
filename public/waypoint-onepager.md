# Waypoint — Festival Connectivity Partner

**Connectivity that survives the crowd.**

## What we do

We help festival organizers and rental partners deliver reliable on‑site connectivity so fans can find each other, message even when LTE is congested, and enjoy supplemental high‑bandwidth internet for uploads, streams, and transactions.

## Solutions

1) Friend‑Finding & Crew Messaging — Direction‑finding devices and mesh messaging that work under heavy cellular congestion.
2) Temporary Festival Internet — Rapid backhaul (e.g., satellite or licensed microwave) distributed via pop‑up Wi‑Fi/HaLow nodes.
3) Ops & Safety Comms — Staff channels, SOS, and rendezvous tooling that complements existing radios, CCTV, and COWs (Cells on Wheels).

## How it works (at a glance)

Backhaul (satellite / microwave / fiber)
→ Waypoint Nodes (Wi‑Fi/HaLow, battery or mains powered)
→ Guests & Staff Devices (friend‑finding, messaging, payments, content).

## Pilot program

We are running limited pilots with select festivals. We provide a rapid site survey, capacity plan, and an on‑site deployment kit. Primary KPIs: shorter reunion times, fewer “no signal” complaints, higher throughput for guest Wi‑Fi and PoS.

## The Compass module

A guest‑experience add‑on that provides live direction‑finding between friends and offline messaging when LTE is jammed. Status: pilot only / coming soon.

## Why organizers choose Waypoint

• Designed to work alongside carriers’ COWs/DAS and existing radios.
• Modular: rent via partners or contract Waypoint directly.
• Practical: planning, deployment, and dashboards packaged for events.
